## Game Alert provides custom event reminders for your favorite sports

## Overview

The ubiquitious sports news apps (eg Yahoo Sports, ESPN, etc.) offer the ability to turn on push notifications for
your favorite teams but offer users little or no options when it comes to filtering game notifications based on two things in particular:

  - Broadcast information (nationally televised vs. local) 
  - Medium of communication

As a busy sports fan I wanted to build an web app that would solve this problem and allow users more flexibility in choosing the type of game that they are reminded of. After all, nobody wants to be reminded of a game that they don't have access to or don't plan to watch anyway.

Game-Alert uses Node.js, express, and PostgreSQL to handle the user sign up and alert management process. Push notifications are made possible by the node-mailer and Twilio APIs. Finally, I used the Cron npm package to run scheduled jobs. I used Heroku to deploy the app.
